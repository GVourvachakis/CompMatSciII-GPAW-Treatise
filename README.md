## About This Repository

This repository is a comprehensive compendium of my work in [**Computational Materials Science II**](https://mscs.uoc.gr/dmst/?courses=computational-materials-science-ii) completed during Spring 2025 as a first year graduate student. It embodies a deep dive into Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the **GPAW** code (real‐space projector augmented wave method) together with the **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**. The focus spans—from the foundational Kohn–Sham and Hohenberg–Kohn theorems all the way to advanced applications such as band structures, Wulff constructions, density of states (DOS), mechanical equation of states, and phonon dispersions.

## TMDs Project

The course project on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) electronic structure and DFT is maintained in the separate repository:

> **TMDs-Electronic-Structure-DFT**
> *[https://github.com/GVourvachakis/TMDs-Electronic-Structure-DFT](https://github.com/GVourvachakis/TMDs-Electronic-Structure-DFT)*

---

## Workflow & Dependencies

* **GPAW**: Real-space PAW DFT solver
* **ASE**: Structure builders, calculators, job management
* Scripts are modular: you can adapt them to new materials by editing the `input.py` files and convergence parameters.
* Reports explain directory structure, dependencies, and step-by-step execution.
Check the **Environment Setup** section of each assignment for case-specific dependencies and implementation nuances.

## Usage & Adaptation

This repository serves as both a complete coursework record and a reference for DFT calculations. The code and methodologies can be adapted for similar materials science research:

- **For students:** Use as a reference for DFT workflows and GPAW/ASE implementations
- **For researchers:** Adapt the modular scripts for your own materials systems
- **For reproducibility:** All calculations include detailed parameters and convergence criteria

If you find this work useful in your research, please consider citing the relevant assignment reports or this repository.
